Designing a database for a gym requires creating a system capable of storing data and enabling its efficient management and processing. 
While designing this database, I focus on ensuring a clear structure, optimal performance, and scalability to meet the needs of users and the gym's business operations.
The database is relational, meaning data is stored in interconnected tables, allowing for flexible and intuitive data storage and retrieval.
